#### How to test
- To test, just launch 2 instances of the game on your local machine [windows, mac, or linux] - and check if they can connect to each other! 
- On both instances, click the 'LAN' button
- On one instance of the machine, click 'Host'.  [This instance will now be the host]
- If the other game instance can't find the host instance automatically, click 'Manual setup' and key in the IP address seen at the bottom of the screen :)
- Once you've done that, it should join you to the host instance [^^^!!!!!]
[Once i've gotten round to adding online, you should be able to click 'Online' without the game crashing or giving errors :D]
